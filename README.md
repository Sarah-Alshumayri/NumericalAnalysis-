# Numerical Analysis Project Using MATLAB

## Overview
This project, conducted in Spring 2023 for MATH310 at Effat University, explores numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using MATLAB. It specifically focuses on the Euler, Taylor, and Runge-Kutta methods.

## Key Methods
1. **Euler Method**: A simple technique using a first-order Taylor series approximation.
2. **Taylor Method**: Utilizes Taylor series expansions, providing greater accuracy with higher-order derivatives.
3. **Runge-Kutta Method (RK4)**: Offers higher accuracy through a weighted average of intermediate points.
